This subpackage provides functionality for collecting and filtering aligned
sequencing reads from a BAM file, determining the alleles they suggest at
a locus, and assesing the evidence for particular variants.

In this subpackage, the records stored in the BAM file are referred to as
"alignments," whereas the term "read" may be more familiar. We use the term
"alignment" for consistency with the SAM specification, and since an
individual read from the sequencer may generate any number of alignments in
the case of chimeric alignments and secondary alignments.
