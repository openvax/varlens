class Pileup(object):
    '''
    A Pileup is a collection of PileupElement instances at a particular locus.

    Attributes
    ----------
    locus : Varcode.Locus
        The reference locus. Must be length 1, i.e. a single base.

    elements : OrderedDict of PileupElement instances
        This is logically and ordered set, which we implement as an OrderedDict
        with all values mapping to None.
    '''
    def __init__(self, locus, elements):
        '''
        Construct a new Pileup.

        Parameters
        ----------
        locus : Varcode.Locus
            The reference locus. Must be length 1, i.e. a single base.

        elements : iterable of PileupElement
            The pileup elements. The locus field of these instances must 
            match the locus parameter.

        Append a PileupElement to this Pileup. If an identical PileupElement is
        already part of this Pileup, do nothing.

    def filter(self, filters):
        '''
        Apply filters to the pileup elements, and return a new Pileup with the
        filtered elements removed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        filters : list of PileupElement -> bool callables
            A PileupUp element is retained if all filters return True when
            called on it.
