    '''
    A PileupElement represents the segment of an alignment that aligns to a
    particular base in the reference.

    Attributes
    ----------
    locus : Varcode.Locus
        The reference locus. Must be length 1, i.e. a single base.

    offset_start : int
        0-based start offset into the alignment sequence, inclusive

    offset_end : int
        0-based end offset into the alignment sequence, exclusive

    alignment : pysam.AlignedSegment
        pysam alignment instance

    alignment_key : tuple
        value computed from the alignment instance that uniquely specifies its
        properties. Used for comparisons since pysam.AlignedSegment instances
        do not support a useful notion of equality (they compare using object
        identity). See `read_evidence.alignment_key` for the implementation of
        this key.
