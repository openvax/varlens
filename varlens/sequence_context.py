    """
    Retrieve the surronding reference region from a variant.

    SNVs are canonicalized so the reference base is a pyrmidine (C/T). For
    indels the reverse complement will still be taken if the first base of
    the reference is not a pyrmidine, but since the reference will also be
    reversed, that doesn't guarantee it will start with a pyrmidine.

    Parameters
    ----------
    reference_fasta : FastaReference
        reference sequence from pyfaidx package

    contig : str
        Chromosome of the variant

    inclusive_start : int
        start of the variant in 1-based inclusive coordinates

    inclusive_end : int
        end of the variant in 1-based inclusive coordinates

    alt : string
        alt sequence

    context_length : int
        number of bases on either side of the variant to return

    Returns
    ---------
    A tuple of (5', mutation, 3') where
        5' - bases immediately 5 prime to the mutation
        
        3' - bases immediately 3 prime to the mutation
        
        mutation - the ref sequence followed by a > character followed by the
            the alt sequence
